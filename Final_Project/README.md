## Background and main Idea
### Background research

### Inspiration from Cyborg manifesto
"It is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the biological organism).
-A Cyborg Manifesto"
The author's statement inspired me. In this state, is language also abandoned? Maybe you have a Cyborg way of communicating vague ideas that have no boundaries? Such as smoke
### Main idea
TO SIMULAT HOW PUBLIC OPINION PRODUCED WITH A HYBRID MEDIUM
## SPECIFIC CONCEPT
### Thinking of meduim

for this step, I research several way to be the medium of the installation
* bubble Different bubbles represent different ideas, and they react with each other in the container
* fog Using the colors of the fog to represent different ideas, they will merge in the container
* screen Make a video game to demonstrate this
Finally I decided to use fog as a medium. I think it would be really interesting to see how different colors of fog react to each other

It consists of an interactive interface and a reaction device,the interactive interface will read your motion state, color; A button that allows you to interact, and a screen that outputs information. The reactor consists of aerosols in three primary colours, which operate for a period of time determined by the value of the colour sensor, and then a small fan feeds the mist into the reactor.
## Development
the development of my project has a long period, here is three challenge I had faced.
* color sensor I used color sensors once many years ago, but for a completely different purpose. I rewrote the code and tested it repeatedly, but the results were always inaccurate. Finally, I decided to use the method described in the Case of Arduino Project Book to make a color sensor with photosensitive resistance.
* atomizer 
* screen
