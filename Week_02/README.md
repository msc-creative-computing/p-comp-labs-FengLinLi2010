# Night guard
## Background
 There is a hallway in my house, and every night when I go out of the study to my bedroom, it feels dark. So I wanted to make a lamp that would start working at night and light up automatically when someone walked by.
 The duels were also very varied. There are simple, casual rock-paper-scissors, and also pistols that would kill someone with the flick of the trigger.

## How to use
 You don't have to do anything, and the Night Guard automatically kicks in as night falls. When someone stealthily passes in front of it, it lights up its lamp to illuminate the intruder.
